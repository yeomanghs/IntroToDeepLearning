Suppose you have a 10x10x3 colour image input and you want to stack two convolutional layers 
with kernel size 3x3 with 10 and 20 filters respectively. 
How many parameters do you have to train for these two layers?

After the first layer you have 10 channels instead of 3.

Given the input is 3x3 with depth 3 and 10 filters it results in (3*3*3+1)*10 parameters.

But in the second layer the depth is 10, cause of the first layer. So it becomes (3*3*10+1)*20

(3*3*3+1)*10 + (3*3*10+1)*20 = 2100
